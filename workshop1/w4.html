    <h3>Code and its Humanity</h3>
	

    <blockquote>
     
      
      "Merriam Webster defines code as the following"
      <ul>
      	<li> a set of laws or regulations</li>
      	<li> a set of ideas or rules about how to behave</li>
      	<li> a set of letters, numbers, symbols, etc., that is used to secretly send messages to someone</li>
      </ul> 
      "but coding in many ways is far greater. Code as a synonym
      acts as a guide to determine what actios are apropriate. 
      These codes act as structure, a stable environment for ideas 
      to come to fruition and descisions to have a moral and ethical compass;

    <blockquote>
      "Presumably man's spirit should be elevated if he can better review his shady past and analyze more completely and objectively his present problems. He has built a civilization so complex that he needs to mechanize his records more fully if he is to push his experiment to its logical conclusion and not merely become bogged down part way there by overtaxing his limited memory. His excursions may be more enjoyable if he can reacquire the privilege of forgetting the manifold things he does not need to have immediately at hand, with some assurance that he can find them again if they prove important."
